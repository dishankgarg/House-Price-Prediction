## House Price Prediction

This project involves predicting house prices based on various features using machine learning techniques. The process is divided into two main steps: data preprocessing and model creation.

### 1. Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis. This step includes:

- **Loading Data**: Import the raw dataset.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Impute or remove missing values to ensure data quality.
- **Feature Encoding**: Convert categorical features into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding.
- **Feature Scaling**: Normalize or standardize features to improve model performance.
- **Splitting Data**: Divide the data into training and testing sets.

### 2. Model Creation

Model creation involves training a predictive model on the preprocessed data. This step includes:

- **Selecting a Model**: Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests).
- **Training the Model**: Fit the model to the training data.
- **Evaluating the Model**: Assess model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R-squared.
- **Tuning Hyperparameters**: Optimize model performance by adjusting hyperparameters.
